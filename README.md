# XR4HRC - Excellence in Extended Reality for Human-Robot Collaboration

Welcome to the XR4HRC project repository, a visionary endeavor set to redefine human-robot collaboration through the power of Extended Reality (XR). At this juncture, we are in the pivotal design phase of developing an XR application that promises to transform training within the cutting-edge environment of IFARLAB's robotic lab.

## About the Project

XR4HRC aims to craft an immersive XR training platform, fostering an intuitive and interactive learning experience for users. This initiative stands at the forefront of integrating advanced XR solutions with robotic technologies, preparing individuals for the nuanced dynamics of future human-robot interaction.

### Vision and Goals:

- **Innovative Training Experience:** We are designing an XR application that will simulate real-world scenarios within a robotic lab setting, offering users a hands-on approach to learning and interaction with virtual robotic systems.
- **Curriculum Development:** In collaboration with BEST, we are meticulously crafting a curriculum that encapsulates comprehensive training and examination modules, ensuring a robust educational foundation in human-robot collaboration.

## Current Status

The MVP applications are developed for both VR and AR applications! 

## Next Steps

Dissemination activities.
